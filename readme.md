$("input").addEventListener("change", console.log,false)

1. file in public, index.js, load from index.html
2. listen to domready
3. get ref to elements listen to change events on inputs: queryselctorall
4. once have elements and listening to them do something like an api endpoint for watched or not


do the form version first, when dom ready happens hide the save button ( progressive enhancement )
